## Welcome to Foundations of Learning Analytics

> `Foundations of Learning Analytics` are designed for those seeking an introductory understanding of learning analytics and either basic R programming skills or basic Python skills, particularly in the context of STEM education research.

<br/>

It consists of consists of four modules. Each module of the Foundation of LA includes:

## Module Objectives

. . .

By the end of this module:

* Understanding Types of `Learning Environments`:
  - Learners will be able to identify and describe different types of learning environments, explaining their unique features and applications in educational research.

. . .

* Characteristics of `Data`:
  - Learners will gain proficiency in recognizing and categorizing various data formats commonly used in educational research by the end of this section.

. . .



## Education Data

In this slide, we will explore the various types of educational data that are crucial for understanding and enhancing the learning experience. These data categories include:

. . .

- Interaction between instructors and students

. . .

- Administrative data

. . .

- Demographic data

. . .


- Student affectivity

. . .

:::{.notes}

Interaction between Instructors and Students: Examining how students and teachers engage through quizzes, exercises, and communication.

Administrative Data: Insights into school and teacher-related information, providing a structural view of the educational environment.

Demographic Data: Analysis of student demographics, such as age and gender, demographic data can be used to understand diverse learning needs.

Student Affectivity: Focuses on the emotional and motivational aspects of students, crucial for personalized learning experiences.

Each category plays a vital role in shaping educational strategies and outcomes.

Digital learning environments include any set
of technology-based methods that can be applied to support learning and instruction.

According to Krumm et al, Digital Learning Environments have fueled data intensive research in education more than any other data.

The ones we are probably most familiar with are....

Face-to-face contact between educators and students organized through lectures, class discussion, small groups, individual seat work, and so on. Traditional education systems are classified in different levels UNESCO. These
systems gather information on student attendance, marks, curriculum goals, class, schedule information, and so on. Finally, it is important to note that all these traditional systems can also use computer-based educational systems as
a complementary tool to face-to-face sessions.

Digital Learning Systems or Computer use computers in education to provide direction, to instruct or to manage instructions given to the student. The global use of Internet and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have led to today's plethora of new web-based intelligent educational systems. Gibson and Frietas (2016) suggest the function of technology as an active participant in data generation is significant, as it is involved in the intricate process of data creation. This process stems from the dynamic interplay between the learner and the digital learning environment, as well as from the collaborative data production by the learner, environment, and social context. Such collaborative situations give rise to a wide range of diverse data sources, which exhibit substantial variation. It becomes necessary to harmonize and integrate these distinct data sources together.

Blended (“blended learning,” “hybrid learning,” and “mixed-mode instruction”) combine face-to-face instruction with computer-mediated instruction. Before COVID we saw some use but after COVID we saw an increase in the use of Digital Learning Systems and Blended.

:::{.notes}
Adaptive and Intelligent Hypermedia System (AIHS) - These systems attempt to be more adaptive by building a model of the goals, preferences, and knowledge of each individual student and using this model throughout interaction with the student in order to adapt to the needs of that student. The data recorded by AIHs are similar to ITS data.

ITS - ITSs provide direct customized instruction or feedback to students by modeling student behavior and changing its mode of interaction with each student based on its individual model. Normally, it consists of a domain model, student model, and pedagogical model. ITSs record all student-tutor interaction (mouse clicks, typing, and speech).

Test and quiz system - The main goal of these systems is to measure the students' level of knowledge with respect to one or more concepts or subjects by using a series of questions/items and other prompts for the purpose of gathering information from respondents. They store a great deal of information about students' answers, calculated scores, and statistics.

:::{.notes}
In data-intensive research we might acquire data from LMS, SIS or another source. Data maybe to big for a typical  database  software  tools  to  capture,  store,  manage,  and  analyze”

Those data are similar but different because 
1. the tasks that students are engaged in and 
2. how data from those tasks are collected and stored by the technology. 

We identify four main types of data structures.
- structured
- unstructured
- semi-structured and 
- meta-data

**STRUCTURED - TAB**

Structured data is Quantitative in nature
Here we see the rows and columns nice and tidy. 
- data is tidy when each column is a variable, each row is an observation, and each cell is a single value.

We typically have tidy data in Excel files or SQL databases that we can import using the readr function or here function.

- Tabular - relational data. 
Examples might include:
- performance data (current and prior)
- demographic data (student’s ethnic and or group or disability)

Each field (variable) is discrete and can be accessed separately or jointly along with data from other fields (variables).

**UNSTRUCTURED TAB**

Unstructured data is Qualitative in nature
and includes:
- Non-Relational Data
- sensor data, web logs, clickstreams, keystroke capture data, emails, images and videos

Text Heavy relationships between nodes
IE: Audio, video, dates SQL database


**SEMI-*STRUCTURED-TAB**
Semi-structured data includes Qualitative 
Triangular Data (uses surveys and interview answers)
Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not conform with the formal structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables.

Semi structured can also include log data.

It is a self-describing structure that contains tags
examples: Social media, JSON and XML, Social Networkdata


**META-DATA - TAB**

Not in the readings but something to think about is Meta-data collection, such as the field dates, times and locations of photos, videos and other structured data about data.
 - contexts and purposes for why the data was collected
