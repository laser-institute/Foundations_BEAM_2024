## Welcome to Foundations code along for `Module 1`

> `Foundations of Learning Analytics` are designed for those seeking an introductory understanding of learning analytics and either basic R programming skills or basic Python skills, particularly in the context of STEM education research. The following code along is aimed at preparing you for the first section of the case study.

:::{.notes}

**Prepare** for a data-intensive analysis with clear and refined research questions with an understanding of where the data came from. 
For example, Krumm et al uses the example surrounding an activity system for which the technology was used. 

You may ask yourself - Is it for instructional, reward or even a social collaborative context? Having that understanding will allow for more refined understanding when formulating guiding research questions for the analysis. Identify what gets collected and stored by technology is important for the development of the research question.

Here you may even refine your research question after having a better idea of where the data came from. The question may also be refined and redeveloped after you have started the data intensive analysis.

The Learning Analysis Cycle is not a linear process but rather a process of phases that can be moved around.

In this code-along session, we will concentrate on the "Prepare" phase of the Learning Analytics (LA) cycle. Before we delve into that, it's essential to gain some context regarding the study that will inform our discussions today and over next three modules.

## Module Objectives

. . .

By the end of this module:

* Know how to read in the data:
  - Learners will be able to identify and describe different types of learning environments, explaining their unique features and applications in educational research.

. . .

* Characteristics of `Data`:
  - Learners will gain proficiency in recognizing and categorizing various data formats commonly used in educational research by the end of this section.

## Context of the Problem

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
Macfadyen, L. P., & Dawson, S. (2010). [Mining LMS data to develop an "early warning system" for educators: A proof of concept.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131509002486?via%3Dihub) *Computers & education*,Â *54*(2), 588-599.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out style="font-size: 30px" }
- Explores specific online activities of students indicating their academic success.
- Focused on "early warning systems" in higher education.
- Research was extracted from course-based instructor tracking logs and the BB Vista production server.
- Data Sources
- A **self-report survey** assessing three aspects of studentsâ€™ motivation
- **Log-trace data,** such as data output from the learning management system (LMS)
- **Academic achievement data**
- Discussion board data
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
Research Questions:

- Which LMS tracking data variables correlate significantly with
    student achievement?
    
- How accurately can measures of student online activity in an online 
course site predict student achievement in the course under study?
